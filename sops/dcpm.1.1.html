Procedure Notes
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When accessing a patient's enrollment details, do not modify or change information. Only Quality Assurance is authorized to edit enrollment details. Contact Quality Assurance with questions about the order. </li>
  <br/>

  <li>If the donor appears to have any difficulty understanding English, request that the donor use a qualified interpreter or bilingual screener. If a qualified interpreter or bilingual screener is not available, defer the donor for one day, and encourage
    the donor to schedule an appointment when an interpreter or bilingual screener is available. See <b>DRCT.3.2</b> for information on requesting a third-party interpreter. </li>
  <br/>

  <li>If an allogeneic donor indicates that they are not able to donate due to a risk found on the <i>Donor Educational
	Materials</i>, ask the donor to self-defer. There is no need to register the donor. </li>
  <br/>

</ul>

Procedure Steps

  This procedure is divided into the following sub procedures:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the reason for donation; see <a href=#1.1.1>1.1.1, Determine the Reason for Donation</a>.</li>
  <li>Initiate apheresis paperwork according to <a href=#1.1.2>1.1.2, Register the Donor in IBBIS</a>.</li>
  <li>Check and prime the kit according to <a href=#1.1.3>1.1.3, Handle Donation Paperwork</a>.</li>
</ul>

<!--Procedure Section 1-->
<h4><a name="1.1.1">
